# Random-Forest-Regression-on-cardekho-dataset
This Machine Learning algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm and bagging technique that uses an ensemble learning method for regression in machine learning.     
Data preprocessing has been carried out, and Random Forest Regressor algorithm with a Hyperparameter Tuning has been used to achieve an adjusted R-Squared value as 0.9577067604277395.
