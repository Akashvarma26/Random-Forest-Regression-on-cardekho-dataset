# Random-Forest-Regression-on-cardekho-dataset
This Machine Learning algorithm is a supervised learning algorithm and bagging technique that uses an ensemble learning method for regression in machine learning.    
      
This Model basically predicts the selling price of the car based on the features of dataset.Data Cleaning, Data Exploration was done to select correct and useful features for training the model.I also performed Hyper Parameter Tuning for getting effective predictions and higher accuracy. The Accuracy / r squared score of the model was found to be 0.9577067604277395.
